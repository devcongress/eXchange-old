  ##The #eXchange series
  `#eXchange` is a monthly remote Google Hangouts session with the most
  proactive and pragmatic of software engineers, designers, and copywriters in
  Ghana. It's run in the format of any programming podcast you've listened: a
  guest who tells his story, patiently answers questions from everyone part of
  the discussion, and then we have a nice time together. Want to join any
  #eXchange session? Register for all so you get automatically invited to every
  episode or register on a per episode basis. (Protip: Register once and for
  all.)

  Got something to #eXchange? [Volunteer as a guest](http://exchange.devcongress.com/guests/volunteer). We'd contact you
  immediately.
